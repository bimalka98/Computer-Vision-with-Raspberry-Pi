|The Raspberry Pi (RPi) is a series of credit card-sized single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools and developing countries. Official Link: [Raspberry Pi Homepage](https://raspberrypi.com)|OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez. The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source Apache 2 License.

## ðŸ”´ Getting Started Guide

1. Remotely access the RPi Desktop using VNC viewer.

  <br><br>

  ### *Accessing the Rpi through the command prompt for the first time(with Rpi OS installation)*

  ***Watch these videos first to know how to install rpi OS and configure the pi to autoconnect to the local wifi network at booting***

  - [Setup Raspberry PI OS with SSH and WIFI the NEW (3/2021) Easy Way](https://youtu.be/nZyyfJYOhbM) ; 
  - [Setup raspberry pi without monitor | Raspberry pi SSH/VNC remote access | Setup VNC server](https://youtu.be/AZj2uON6JaI)

  1. Open command prompt and type following commands.

  ####  Input

  ```shell

  bimalka98@DEVICE:~$ ssh pi@rpibimalka98
  The authenticity of host 'rpibimalka98 (192.168.8.102)' can't be established.
  ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:DHkDrtlf2nwgWS9F0yofVPDFauFG7fqVtH6p2SQTmQE.
  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
  Warning: Permanently added 'rpibimalka98,192.168.8.102' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
  pi@rpibimalka98's password: YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE
  ```

  ####  Output
  ```shell
  Linux rpibimalka98 5.10.92-v7+ #1514 SMP Mon Jan 17 17:36:39 GMT 2022 armv7l

  ####  Input

  ```shell
  # Initializing the VNC server inside the pi
  pi@host:~ $ vncserver
  ```

  ####  Output
  ```shell
  VNC(R) Server 6.7.2 (r42622) ARMv6 (May 13 2020 19:34:20)

    .
  New desktop is rpibimalka98:2 (192.168.x.xxx:x)

  ```

  2. Now open VNC viewer and type the server's ip produced by the above last command! -> 192.168.x.xxx:x

  3. Provide the login credentials when asked
    - **username**: pi 
    - **password**: YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE

  4. That's it. You are in!

</details>

2. Open the terminal and change the directory to `Desktop`.
3. Install `git` on the RPi & Clone this repository.

```shell
pi@host:~/Desktop $ sudo apt-get install git
pi@host:~/Desktop $ git clone https://github.com/bimalka98/Computer-Vision-with-Raspberry-Pi.git
```

4. Get into the cloned repository.

```shell
pi@host:~/Desktop $ cd Computer-Vision-with-Raspberry-Pi/
```
5. Give execution permission to the shell script.

```shell
pi@host:~/Desktop/Computer-Vision-with-Raspberry-Pi $ chmod +x setup.sh
```

6. Run the shell script and wait until it finishes its job.
```shell
pi@host:~/Desktop/Computer-Vision-with-Raspberry-Pi $ ./setup.sh
```
7. Connect a USB camera/ RPi camera to the RPi.
8. Change directory to `/Application/bin/`.

```shell
pi@host:~/Desktop/Computer-Vision-with-Raspberry-Pi $ cd Application/bin/
```

9. Run the executable and check whether it really detects faces

```shell
pi@host:~/Desktop/Computer-Vision-with-Raspberry-Pi/Application/bin $ ./face_detection
```
